# Antigravity Playbook — Ozzmosis / Genesis

## What Antigravity is for
- Agentic execution, not chat.
- Plan -> approve -> execute -> evidence.
- Use artifacts as review units.

## Canonical commands
- Always show `git status -sb`
- Always show `git diff --cached --name-only` before commit

## Repo rules
- PLAN.md never committed.
- Artifacts raw outputs never committed.
- Vault closes are mandatory and isolated commits.
