# OS-GENESIS-CONTRACTS-001 - CLOSE

## Goal
Define Genesis canonical contracts v1 outside Elysian Brain (product owns its contracts).

## Deliverables
- Python contracts (backend): apps/alvaro-core/src/alvaro/genesis/contracts.py
- TypeScript contracts (frontend): apps/mycelium-front/src/lib/genesis/contracts.ts
- Spec doc: docs/GENESIS_CONTRACTS.md

## Commits (atomic, by WP)
- WP1 (python): 4e78eee398ffb52dd6d28e548d1a15c9644129a6
- WP2 (ts): 7ef59fcc342ad10b8d621fd5dcf3f6bf254751de
- WP3 (docs): 2e2c17638c3d952540d62decb05f10778f266257

## Notes (Governance)
- Contracts are owned by Genesis domain (not by Elysian Brain).
- No endpoints, engines, or business logic created in this OS.

## Verdict
OS-GENESIS-CONTRACTS-001 closed with contracts v1.0 established (python + ts) and documented.
