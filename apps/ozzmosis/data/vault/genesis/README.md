# Genesis Vault (SSOT)

This folder is the SSOT (operational) for Genesis-specific decisions, contracts,
runbooks, and closure notes. Prefer referencing canonical docs instead of copying
them to avoid drift.

## Canonical References

- Contract: `docs/GENESIS_CONTRACT.md`
- Dev runbook: `docs/GENESIS_DEV_RUNBOOK.md`
- E2E smoke evidence: `docs/GENESIS_E2E_SMOKE.md`
- SDK map (inventory): `docs/ozzmosis/sdk-map.md`

## Structure

- `os/`: OS open/close notes (Vault-ready)
- `_runs/`: local run evidence placeholders (gitkeep only; real outputs stay untracked unless explicitly required)
