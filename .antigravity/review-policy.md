# Review Policy — Genesis

## Levels
- Always Ask:
  - architecture, contracts, policies, CI workflows, security, anything touching Vault/SSOT
- Agent Decides:
  - local refactors, docs, non-critical UI polishing within Codex constraints
- Always Proceed:
  - disposable prototypes outside main codepaths (must not be merged without review)

## Default
Always Ask.
